Above is a picture of my dog *Tacos*, she is pretty cute, and we got her in Beijing. I have 2 sisters, Marie in 12th grade and Alice in 6th grade. Marie is mostly chill but sometimes she can be **very** annoying. My other sister cries a lot and is even *more* annoying. 

My least favorite class is English or history, but it really just depends on the day. ~I love art~ I used to love art, but now that I have new classmates I'm realizing how much better my old classmates were. Now here is a table of how many books I've read each year because the decrease is honestly just sad.

| 2022        | 2023           | 2024  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 40     | 1 | 1 |

I have a good start for 2024, so hopefully I don't end up like how I did in 2023 again. Bye!
